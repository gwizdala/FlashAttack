# FlashAttack
HackDuke Project - RPG Flashcard Battling

FlashAttack is a competive flashcard game aimed for audiences from elementary to middle school. Instead of the normal tedium associated with flashcard questions, the user is presented with a battle screen interface populated with their own customized character vs. a randomized boss on a random stage. To effectively "defeat the boss", the player then completes the flashcard deck. However, as with all boss battles there is a chance of failure - too many incorrect answers and the user will run out of lives instead.

Although the game increases the fun of flashcards, the real draw is in the competitive nature associated with the product. Connecting to a social network, the user will be able to track their stats and progress as they complete/make more flashcards. Statistics such as average time to answer, number of correct cards in a row or difficulty of cards selected will award the player XP of which they can use to level up their character and subsequently purchase new items for them to battle with. However, these stats are not intrinsically their own - the player will be able to see statistics of other players, enticing them to continue retrying the flashcard decks to improve their score. Inadvertently the player will memorize the answers on the cards in order to be the best competitor out there, learning without even realizing it and while having fun.
